See the blog posting on www.switchdoc.com about setting up the DataLogger:

To Install:

Install the following tools and libraries:

Installing MySQL<BR>
MySQL - Use the following tutorial:   http://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-mysql-phpmyadmin/

Install a User (datalogger in this case):<BR>
(you need to do "sudo mysql -r root -p" in this tutorial)<BR>
https://howchoo.com/g/mtm3zdq2nzv/how-to-add-a-mysql-user-and-grant-privileges

and then install the python bindings:

sudo python3 -m pip install PyMySQL
sudo pip install mysql-python

Installing apscheduler 

sudo pip install setuptools --upgrade
sudo pip install apscheduler

Installing Apache

sudo apt-get install apache2 -y

Installing MatPlotLib


matplotlib - Install the following packages (This will take quite a while)

$ sudo apt-get install libblas-dev        ## 1-2 minutes

$ sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev      ## 1-2 minutes

$ sudo apt-get install python-dev        ## Optional

$ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev ## Optional speed up execution

$ sudo apt-get install gfortran           ## 2-3 minutes

$ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools  ## ?

$ sudo easy_install scipy                 ## 2-3 hours

$ sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib  ## 1 hour


Installing httplib2

sudo apt-get install python-httplib2

Installing INA219

sudo pip install pi-ina219

Finally, copy DataLogger.html to /var/www/html

sudo cp DataLogger.html /var/www/html

and finally, set up the database:

Use phpmyadmin or sql command lines to add the included SQL file to your MySQL databases.

example: mysql -u root -p < DataLogger.sql

user: root

password: password

Obviously with these credentials, don't connect port 3306 to the Internet. Change them if you aren't sure.


Now you can run DataLogger

To Use:

Change the configuration variables to support your setup:
<pre>
# configuration variables
# set to true if present, false if not

INA3221_Present = True
ADS1115_Present = True
</pre>

To Add Devices:

1) Add a configuration Variable<BR>
2) Add device initialization code<BR>
3) Build your custom functions file containing the read device/MySQL code and the graph building function<BR>
4) Add your graph to the provided HTML file and copy it to /var/www/html<BR>
